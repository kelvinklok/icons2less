# icons2less

Just sharing a fun side project I wrote to practice JS.

The script reads Photohop layer names and exports 2 files for app building process: a LESS file with icon sprite coordinates and a XLS file for sharing class names to a XML writer. It won't serve much use outside of this workflow but it did cut down hours of work at its peak!

The script assumes you have the relevant Photoshop template set up correctly.
